I love the feel and sophistication of its superiority. I like people with a keen mind and at the same time easy to talk to. These qualities can be combined perfectly natural. However, things like people look miserable, if these properties are connected to them artificially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, think of life as a prototype. We can conduct experiments, make discoveries, and change our perspectives. We can look for opportunities to turn processes into projects that have tangible outcomes. We can learn how to take joy in the things we create whether they take the form of a fleeting experience or an heirloom that will last for generations. We can learn that reward comes in creation and re-creation, no just in the consumption of the world around us. Active participation in the process of creation is our right and our privilege. We can learn to measure the success of our ideas not by our bank accounts by their impact on the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not enough that we build products that function, that are understandable and usable, we also need to build products that bring joy and excitement, pleasure and fun, and, yes, beauty to people\u2019s lives. Creativity is to discover a question that has never been asked. If one brings up an idiosyncratic question, the answer he gives will necessarily be unique as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The goal of a designer is to listen, observe, understand, sympathize, empathize, synthesize, and glean insights that enable him or her to make the invisible visible.<\/p><cite>Andrew Grove<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/terazzo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/b-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"435\" data-full-url=\"http:\/\/localhost\/terazzo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/b-1.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/bslthemes.com\/mireya\/2020\/09\/24\/follow-your-own-design-process\/b-1\/\" class=\"wp-image-435\"\/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/terazzo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/b-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"432\" data-full-url=\"http:\/\/localhost\/terazzo\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/b-5.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/bslthemes.com\/mireya\/2020\/09\/24\/follow-your-own-design-process\/b-5\/\" class=\"wp-image-432\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s the whole Buddhist thing about the essence of a bowl being its emptiness\u2014that\u2019s why it\u2019s useful.
